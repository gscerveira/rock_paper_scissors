# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This webpage is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. But instead of the traditional way, you have to guess what the opponent is thinking of.

The page is made with, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The JavaScript was written first and then the HTML and CSS were used to add an interface to the game, which was originally playable only through the console.

This project was done as a part of The Odin Project full stack web devellopment curriculum.
