            You're a junior Web Developer. After countless hours of trying to fix a bug in your code, you can feel your brain
            cells being fried.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can't think of anything else, so, in a desperate moment, you start frantically rubbing your monitor screen hoping
            the solution will magically appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            You stop rubbing and nothing happened. Defeated, you get ready to turn off the computer, but then a mist starts coming
            out of the screen, you think you're delirious but it starts to take shape.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a genie! It challenges you to guess what it's thinking of: Rock, Paper or Scissors. You have 10 chances, if you
            get it right 5 times the genie will fix your code!
